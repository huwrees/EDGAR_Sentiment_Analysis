Kubrick, DE32, Elephant and Castle

Background: In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires public companies to file 10-K report 
            annually. The 10-K form gives detailed report on the financial position of the company and contains a 
            summary of relevant topics such as business activities, risk factors and legal proceedings.

Aim of project:  To create a package called edgar which determines whether negative sentiment 10-K filings can be used to predict short term                    movements in share prices.
 
Note:   For word classifications, the Loughran-McDonald dictionary for word classifications designed 
        specifically for financial documents is used.
